## API Documentation

### OpenAPI

After you configured the application, and it is up and running, you can access the API specification on the `/api/documentation` path.

### Postman

The Postman collection can be found on the same repository inside de folder `postman`.

- The collection is configured to get the _{{BASE_URL}}_ from the Postman Environment.
- There are public and restricted endpoints. The first step is to register a user and issue an API token.
- After you obtain an API token, click on the _restricted_ folder and put the token under authorization (bearer token). The restricted endpoints will inherit the authorization from the parent folder.
